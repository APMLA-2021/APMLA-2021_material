For any general question about the course, use GitHub issues. Before posting, please make sure your question has not been previously answered. Only in case of private question, send us an email. 

**NEWS**: (informal) registration to the class: please fill up the google form [here](https://forms.gle/sb3yQLZfRybDrDwT9), it is asked by the Uni admin.

**NEWS**: **Assignement has been uploaded!**   
Please use the pseudo code that you find inside the `A1` folder as a template to write the solutions, rename it as surname_name_A1_2021.ipynb (if you are submitting by yourself, otherwise surname1_name1_surname2_name2_A1_2021.ipynb if you are submitting in a 2-people group, similar for 3-people groups, where you should replace surname and name with yours). Similarly, please upload a unique .zip file containing the notebook and in case additional material (e.g. figures), again using the format `surname_name_A1_2021.zip` (and similar for groups of 2 or 3 people).  
The assignement should be submitted at this [submission form](https://forms.gle/vznp9BwcKjzCqcNH7).  
**Submission deadline**: Friday 02.07.21 (24.00pm). 

**Exam** dates are confirmed: 
1. Wed 28.07.21, 14.00-16.00pm (room N10) 
2. Wed 29.09.21, 14.00-16.00pm (room  N16+N15) 

**Plan**:  19 Apr 2021 - 31 Jul 2021, 14 weeks, 2+2 hr/week, 14 weeks, 56hr

**Lectures**:  Wednesdays 14:15-16pm online on [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/94529176606), **Passcode**: 160621
A **passcode** will be posted here the day of the lecture, it will change from week to week.  


**Tutorials**: Friday 16:00-17.45pm  online on [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/99581700609)   

**Feedback**: after every lecture you are free to give a feedback via this [form](https://forms.gle/epwPUbwveRhbRjiq8) (lecture) and this [form](https://forms.gle/QNejgrwBAkUGo4DH6) (tutorial).

**Lecture-free days**: Thursday, 13. Mai 2021 (Christi Himmelfahrt), from Monday, 24. Mai 2021 until Sunday, 30. Mai 2021 (Pfingstpause), Thursday, 3. Juni 2021 (Fronleichnam).  

**Prerequisites**: all the previous knowledge required by the class Probabilistic Machine Learning applies here too. Nothing extra is needed, so if you are following that class, you are good to go here too.
There will be some overlapping contents for sure between the two classes, although my class is more focused on the application side.

For the EXAM, NEED to officially register  either via Campus / ALMA or written if the student cannot register online (closer to the exam date).  

**Grading** : Maximum between 70\% written exam+30\% assignments and 100\% exam.   

* Every assignment is composed by several exercises, which will be released sequentially. Information about assignment submission will be provided later in time but it will be made electronically. 

* Assignment may be done and submitted in groups of up to 3 people (optional).
